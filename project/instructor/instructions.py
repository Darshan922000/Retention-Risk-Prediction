Medium Risk: Focus on strengthening the relationship, offering added value, encouraging feedback, and inviting check-ins.

High Risk: Focus on expressing genuine care, proactive support, reassurance, and offering personalized solutions — but without revealing or mentioning the risk score directly.

Guidelines:

Subject Line: Friendly, positive, and relevant to the client’s situation.

Body: Make the client feel valued, cared for, and confident about staying.

Tone: Professional, supportive, and psychologically appropriate to client sentiment.
